# plan-to-issues

Turns `plan.md` into GitHub issues that workers can pick up cold. Easiest with `gh`, authenticated,
in a shell this agent can run.

## Steps

1. Read `plan.md`, `AGENTS.md` and `docs/adr/`.
2. Draft the split as a table: title · plan section · scope · done when · blocked by.
   One issue per unit of work.
3. **Stop and show the table to the human.** Publish nothing until they approve it.
4. Ask the human what every issue here must carry (fields, labels, wording), unless it is
   already written down in this session or in the repo.
5. Create each issue in dependency order, so blocked-by can cite real numbers:

   ```sh
   gh issue create --title "<title>" --body-file <tmp.md>
   ```

6. Record every issue URL from gh's output (not from memory) and reply with the list.

## What every issue carries

Approved by the human for plan morning-digest; use it unless they change it. Label
`plan:<plan name>`, and a body in this order:

```md
Source: plan.md § <n>

## Scope

<what the section asks, in the plan's words; the ADRs and styleguide rules it touches>

## Done when

<the section's "Done when", unchanged>

## Blocked by

<#n (what exactly is needed from it), or —>
```

An issue that waits on someone outside the repo (a reviewer, a human) names that in
Blocked by and stays open until they have answered; "sent" is not "done".

Closing one, with the closing comment from AGENTS.md:

```sh
gh issue close <n> -c "<closing comment>"
```

## No `gh`

Steps 1–4 hold either way. GitHub reachable another way (a connector, the REST API, the web UI):
the same issues, made that way. GitHub issues out of reach altogether: write them as files in
`docs/issues/`, format in ADR 0004, then commit and push.

## Don'ts

- Don't paste the whole plan into one issue, and don't keep issues only in chat.
- Don't invent sections the plan doesn't have. If the plan is unclear, ask.
